# Web Developer Path
This is my version of a guide for learning more about web development. I'm focusing on CSS and JavaScript and using both [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).  I'm following the paid course of Scrimba's Front End Developer Career Path and so far it's been very good.
