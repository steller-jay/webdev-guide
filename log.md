# Coding and Progress Log
Kinda like the [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) but without so many rules!  ;)

* Make daily progress when I can
* Create working things after learning (avoid Tutorial Hell of taking classes, but not being able to apply things)
* Make notes of when I have figured out a difficult topic

## Feb 5th
Setup these pages to keep track of progress and resources

## Feb 8th
Recreated the tribute page from start to finish. So much easier after taking the classes out at scrimba.  FCC is nice, but doesn't really prepare you to start writing code from scratch.
