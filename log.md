# Coding and Progress Log
Kinda like the [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) but without so many rules!  ;)

* Make daily progress when I can
* Create working things after learning (avoid Tutorial Hell of taking classes, but not being able to apply things)
* Make notes of when I have figured out a difficult topic
